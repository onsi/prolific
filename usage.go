Usage:
    prolific [FILE]
        Converts the prolific file FILE to a CSV printed to stdout.
        If FILE is not specified, content is read from STDIN.

        The CSV can be imported manually into Pivotal Tracker, so:

            prolific stories.prolific > stories.csv

        is a useful one-liner.

    prolific template
        Generates a sample 'stories.prolific'.

Syntax:
    Stories are separated by the delimiter:

        ---

    Each story is a block made up of:

        [STORY_TYPE] TITLE

        DESCRIPTION
        DESCRIPTION
        DESCRIPTION

        - [ ] TASK 1
        - [ ] TASK 2

        L: LABEL 1, LABEL 2

    Of these, only TITLE is required and must be on a single line.

    [STORY_TYPE] may be omitted.  If present it must be one of:

        [FEATURE]
        [BUG]
        [CHORE]
        [RELEASE]`)
	os.Exit(1)
}
